## About
This is a basic java app that I am working on. The scope of the app is to act as a remote for a Bluetooth controlled car.
The remote-controlled car contains a HC-05 Bluetooth module with which we can establish a connection via the app. 
After the connection is established, we can start transmitting commands to the car.
